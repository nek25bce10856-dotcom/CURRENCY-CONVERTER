# PROJECT TITLE CURRENCY-CONVERTER
OVERVIEW
This project is a console-based application written in Python that allows a user to convert an amount of money from one currency to another using a set of pre-defined, hardcoded exchange rates. The application takes a source currency code (e.g., USD), a target currency code (e.g., EUR), and an amount as input. It then calculates and displays the converted value. It is designed to teach input handling, dictionary data structures, and basic arithmetic.
